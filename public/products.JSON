        "description": "A true middleweight naked sportbike for a broad range of riders, the all-new 2022 Z650RS tempts the eye with the timeless beauty of a retro sport. Distinguishing the Z650RS from the larger displacement Z900RS is a slimmer tank and a shorter, more compact tailâ€”all contributing to light handling and an approachable nature.",
